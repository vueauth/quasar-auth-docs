    details: All VueAuth providers follow the same API (Contract). Be it Laravel, Firebase or Supabase, they all work the same.
  - title: Adding Providers Is Simple
    details: Don't see a provider for your backend? No worries! Implement VueAuth's contracts and you're good to go. We even wrote the tests for you!
  - title: Component Libraries
    details: Create auth components for your favourite framework ONCE, and easily swap out providers. Pretty Cool Huh!
